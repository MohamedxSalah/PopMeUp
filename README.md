Pop Me Up is an extension that allows you to open links in a popup both manually and automatically Like Arc Browser!

# The story
I saw this post here https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/18tl6gw/chrome_extension_that_make_the_links_you_click/ 
and I was surprised that there was no extension to do that, as it seemed like an easy thing to do. 

So I wanted to make one but I don't know anything about coding. 
Thus, I decided for fun to use ChatGPT! 

and so after literally a day with 20 hours of work trying to figure out something and not knowing what I'm doing and asking chatGPT why the thing isn't working xD

I created an extension 

# Pop Me Up 

It allows you to open links in a pop-up menu in 2 ways

The first one is the Manual One, which adds an option to the context menu that allows you to open a link as a popup

The second one is the automatic one; it changes the default behavior of clicking on a link from opening as a new tab to opening as a popup automatically.

P.S : I couldn't upload ot on the chrome webstore because I have to pay 5$ to be able to upload there and i'm broke xD

but it's available on firefox webstore
