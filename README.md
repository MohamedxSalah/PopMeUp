# PopMeUp
Pop Me Up and Pop You Up ,  are to extensions that allow you open links in a popup both manually and automatically Like Arc Browser!

The story is that i saw this post here https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/18tl6gw/chrome_extension_that_make_the_links_you_click/ 
and i was surprised that there is no extension to do that, as it seemed like easy thing. 

So i wanted to make one but i don't have any knowledge of coding or anything. 
Thus, i decided for fun to use ChatGPT! 

and so after literally a day with 20 hours of work trying to figure out something and not knowing what i'm doing and asking chatGPT why the thing isn't working xD

I created 2 different extensions.

1- Pop Me Up:  the first one adds an option to the context menu that allows you to open link as a popup

2- Pop You Up: the second one changes the default behavior of you clicking on a link from opening as a new tab to open as a popup automatically. (one bug tho i couldn't fix : it doesn't work with links in youtube description or comments, it works on every other link on any website tho, even reddit and twitter)
